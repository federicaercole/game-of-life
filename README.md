# Game of Life
My version of Conway's Game of Life, built in Typescript.
[Live Version](https://federicaercole.github.io/game-of-life/)

**The code is located in the "src" folder, the file "script.js" is the code before conversion to TypeScript.**

## Features:
- Draw cells on canvas using mouse or create an automatic random formation
- Pause the game
- Clear the canvas

## What I learned doing this project:
- A bit of functional programming
- TTD development with Jest
- Draw on canvas
